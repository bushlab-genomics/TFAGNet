# TFAGNet
This page contains description of the TFAGNet container(https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/bushlab/tfagnet). Here, I have explained how to use this container to score genetic variants for their ability to affect transcription factor(TF) binding affinity. 

# Required installation
docker(https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)

# Downloading the container
You can use the following command to pull the container. Note: This is fairly big container(~40GB), so please clear out some storage space before downloading the container.

```
docker pull bushlab/tfagnet:latest
```

# Running the container
